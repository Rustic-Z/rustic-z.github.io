I am the Louis Skolnick Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University. Starting in Fall 2022, I will be an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Johns Hopkins University.  

My primary research interests are in epistemology and the philosophy of language, with special attention to issues at their intersection. My current projects concern knowledge, belief, assertion, lying, conditionals, and context-sensitivity.
